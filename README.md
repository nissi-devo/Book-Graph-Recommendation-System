<b>Book Recommendation Data Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive data pipeline for creating a book recommendation system. The pipeline processes book metadata and reviews in JSON format, partitions and stores the data in S3 buckets, transforms the data, and loads it into a Neo4j database. The Neo4j database is then queried to serve recommendations through a FastAPI endpoint.
